The project is organized into three folders:

- **[Backend](./backend)**: Contains the API, Queue, Database, ComfyUI, and Ollama.
- **[Frontend](./frontend)**: The UI that communicates with the API.
- **[Worker](./worker)**: The process that generates the books' imagery!

Each subfolder includes instructions for running the project locally. Setup is straightforward,
as everything has been containerized, running `docker compose up` is all thatâ€™s needed.

> [!WARNING]
> You need a good NVIDIA GPU to run this project!!.
