# Frontend

This frontend is built with Vue, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

### Prerequisites
To ensure the frontend works correctly, please start the backend first.

### Run Locally
To run the project locally, use Docker Compose:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
Then open: https://dearbook.docker.localhost

### Tips

You can use `./yarn` or `./npx` instead of yarn/npx to run the container-installed versions, 
so thereâ€™s no need to install Node or other development libraries on your local machine.
